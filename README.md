The goal of this repository is to show how one can deploy their Laravel project in a variety of situations using containers.

We will try to build several versions of the typical stack by Laravel and popular extras from the ecosystem.

In addition, build out pipelines to be used via GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.

* Local Dev via Docker-compose
* Local Dev via Kubernetes
* Production via Docker-compose
* Production via Docker Swarm
* Production via Kubernetes

It is our hope to be able to capture best practices for each part of the process.
